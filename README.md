Functional Programming Game Project
Welcome to my functional programming game project, a result of an examination in the Functional Programming course.

# Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation of a simple game using vanilla JavaScript and adheres to the principles of functional programming. The architecture is based on the Entity Component System (ECS), a widely utilized software pattern in video game development for managing game world objects.

# Game Description

The game features two characters: a player-controlled fighter and an enemy NPC, both starting with 100 health points. The primary objective is for the player to outlast the enemy, and the game concludes when one of them reaches 0 health. The on-screen controls and a start button are provided for a seamless gaming experience. Upon completion, a restart button is displayed, allowing users to reset and replay the game.

# Development Details

Developed in few hours, this project serves as a concise demonstration of functional programming concepts. While the current version may lack extensive functionality, it provides a fundamental showcase of how functional programming principles, specifically ECS, can be applied in game development.
